A quiz app is a tool that allows users to take quizzes on various subjects. The app may include features such as multiple choice questions, timed quizzes, and the ability to track scores and progress. Users may also have the ability to create and share their own quizzes. A quiz app is a tool that allows users to test their knowledge on various topics through a series of multiple choice or true/false questions. It is a interactive way to learn and test knowledge on different subjects. User can select topic of their choice and start taking quiz. It can be used for educational and personal development purposes, as well as for fun and entertainment.<br>
The user has to click on the start button to start the quiz and then the question screen will display the user a question that the user will be given a list of options. To tell the user about the time to solve the problem, a progress bar has been made at the top of the container wall. The user can then simply choose any of the option. The option will be highlighted. The user then click on the button or can wait for the time to end to move to the next question. After all the questions, the result screen will appear displaying the results of the test in the form of percentage.
